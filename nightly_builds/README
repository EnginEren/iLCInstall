# Python script for using ilcinstall to
# perform nightly builds and send a mail
# with the output to a list of users
#

###########################################

How to use:

1st:    make sure you have a symbolic link or a copy of nbuild
        inside the same directory where you have ilcsoft-install

2nd:    edit the nbuild script and change the SETTINGS to your needs
        * important setting to change is mail_addr!!

3nd:    use the template nb-cmake.cfg and adapt it to your system

4th:    create your cronjob

        # call crontab for current user
        $ crontab -e

        # example of a crontab file
        SHELL=/bin/bash
        # enter your email here for receiving output from cron jobs
        MAILTO=your_email@blah.zzz
        # if you have your $HOME dir in afs, cron won't be able to access it because your token
        # will expire. since ilcinstall needs to access your ~/.cvspass for cvs/ccvssh downloads
        # you need to redefine the $HOME variable to your local disk and put a copy of ~./cvspass
        # there. of course you must have logged at least once to each server so that ~/.cvspass
        # contains all the needed passwords.
        HOME=/data/engels/cronhome
        # add the path where ilcinstall is located to the PATH list
        # and also don't forget to add the ccvssh path if you do ccvssh downloads
        PATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/data/engels/tools/ilcinstall:/data/engels/cronhome/bin
         
        # cron syntax is:
        # mm hh MM YY dd
        #
        # examples:
        # 00 * * * *    every hour (X:00)
        # 30 2 * * *    dayly @ 2:30
        # 00 4 * * 1    weekly (mondays @ 4:00)
        # 15 2 1 * *    monthly (1st of the month @ 2:15)
        # 00 5 * * 1-5  workdays @ 5:00
       
        # run dayly at 2:00
        00 2 * * * nbuild /data/engels/tools/ilcinstall/nightly_builds/nb-cmake.cfg
