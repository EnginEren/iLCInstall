How to use:

1st:    copy nbuild script to directory where ilcsoft-install is located (cp nbuild ../)
        edit the nbuild script and check if the settings meet your needs
        * mail_addresses can also be set in the config file

2nd:    use the template nb-release.cfg and adapt it to your needs

3rd:    create your cronjob

        # call crontab for current user
        $ crontab -e

        # example of a crontab file
        SHELL=/bin/bash
        # enter your email here for receiving output from cron jobs
        MAILTO=your_email@blah.zzz
        # keep in mind that ilcinstall tries to access $HOME/.cvspass for cvs/ccvssh
        # downloads, so you have to make sure cron has access or a copy of this file.
        HOME=/data/engels/cronhome
        # don't forget to add the path to ccvssh if you do ccvssh downloads
        PATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
         
        # cron syntax is:
        # mm hh MM YY dd
        #
        # examples:
        # 00 * * * *    every hour (X:00)
        # 30 2 * * *    dayly @ 2:30
        # 00 4 * * 1    weekly (mondays @ 4:00)
        # 15 2 1 * *    monthly (1st of the month @ 2:15)
        # 00 5 * * 1-5  workdays @ 5:00
       
        # run daily at 2:00
        00 2 * * * cd /path/to/ilcinstall && ./nbuild ./nightly_builds/nb-release.cfg
