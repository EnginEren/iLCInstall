#
#################################

This is the first update to the new  developers release series v01-19-xx
that exclusively works with  the new DD4hep based software packages only.

It requires a compiler compatible with c++11 (e.g. gcc49 or higher )
such that c++11 features can be used from now on.

=================================================

# Changes in v01-19  w.r.t. iLCSoft v01-19-01
 
=================================================

## MarlinReco v0-17

S. Lukic
  - Adding SiPID package to MarlinReco.
    For the moment it contains the processor which calculates dE/dx for
    a silicon tracker and writes it to the lcio file.
    Primarily intended for CLICdet but generally applicable.
    DD4hep is used to access geometry.
    CMakeLists.txt in MarlinReco was adjusted. The package is added only
    if DD4hep and MarlinTrk are found.

M.Petric
  - fix in TruthVertexFinder

D. Jeans
  - copy calodigi documentation into Realistic package (+ a few changes to help latex compile)

S. Lu
  - comment out 'ADD_MARLINRECO_PKG( ./Clustering/BCalReco)' for solving
    '*** Break *** segmentation violation' at the end of Marlin run.
    ToDo: To ckeck which ilcsoft package use the same resource (maybe root resource).
